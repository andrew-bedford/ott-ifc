%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
We present a tool called \ottifc, that can automatically generate information-flow control mechanisms from programming language specifications (i.e., syntax and semantics).

%Problem and Motivation: Clearly state the problem being addressed and explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.
\section{Introduction}
Language-based security~\cite{DBLP:conf/dagstuhl/SchneiderMH01} is an active field of research in which techniques from programming languages, such as program analysis, monitoring, rewriting and type checking, are used to enforce security policies. One of the most studied security policy is called \emph{non-interference}. It essentially states that private information may not interfere with the publicly observable behavior of the program. For example, Listings~\ref{listing:explicit-flow} and \ref{listing:implicit-flow} both violate non-interference because someone observing the contents of \lstinline{public} could learn something about \lstinline{private}.

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, caption=Insecure explicit flow, label=listing:explicit-flow]
  public := private
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, caption=Insecure implicit flow, label=listing:implicit-flow]
  if (private > 0) then
    public := 0
  else
    public := 1
  end
\end{lstlisting}

Mechanisms that enforce non-interference are called \\\emph{information-flow control mechanisms}, as they track and control where information may flow during the execution of a program.

In order to help language-based security researchers develop sound

%there are only a handful of information-flow control mechanisms for "real" languages. most papers

\section{Approach and Uniqueness}
We chose to use Ott~\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/SewellNOPRSS10} as our input language. Ott is a programming language specification tool which 



\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,caption=Syntax of a simple imperative language]
arith_expr, a :: ae_ ::=
  | x         
  | n                        
  | a1 + a2                  
  | a1 * a2                       

bool_expr, b :: be_ ::=
  | true                        
  | false   
  | a1 < a2          

commands, c :: cmd_ ::=
  | skip    
  | x := a 
  | c1 ; c2           
  | if b then c1 else c2 end
  | while b do c end   
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Current Status and Future Work}
We have implemented a prototype of our algorithm and validated that it works on two simple imperative languages: one defined using small-step semantics and the other using large-step semantics. We have also begun to draft a soundness proof, that is, a proof showing that the generated mechanisms enforce non-interference.

Before our tool can be of real use to most researchers, much work remains to be done.

\paragraph{Language Support} \ottifc~ currently makes two assumptions about the language: (1) that the syntax be composed of expressions, which may only read the memory, and commands, which may read or write the memory; and (2) that the program configurations be of the form $\langle command, memory\rangle$. While these assumptions helped simplify the implementation, it also restricts the types of languages that can be used in \ottifc. For example, most functional languages would not be supported because in those languages functions can be expressions. 

\paragraph{Language Repository} We are currently in the process of building a repository of languages so that we can test our approach on additional languages. 

\paragraph{Parametrization} For the moment, \ottifc~ only generates one type of information-flow control mechanism: a type system which enforces termination-insensitive non-interference. We plan on parametrizing our tool so that users can choose the type of mechanism to generate (e.g., type system, monitor) and choose some of its features (e.g., flow-sensitivity, termination-sensitivity, progress-sensitivity).

\paragraph{Generating Formal Proofs} We expect that some users will use the mechanisms generated by \ottifc~ as a foundation to build better and more precise mechanisms. One of the most grueling task when building an information-flow control mechanism is to prove its soundness. In order to help those users, we plan on generating a skeleton of the proof in Coq or Isabelle/HOL (both languages are supported by Ott).
